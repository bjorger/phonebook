# phonebook

## Project instructions

Your task is to create a simple phone book application with CRUD operations. Use Typescript, React, React context, react-query, material UI. For the back-end, use Typescript, Apollo GraphQL and any database of your choice. Use docker compose to deploy the entire stack

Your application should provide a form where you can enter in first name, last name, and phone number. You should then be able to perform 4 basic operations: create new entries in your database, read the entries, update entries by editing any of the properties, and delete the entries. It should look something like the image below.

## How to start

To start this application simply run

> docker-compose build
> docker-compose up

After this, the application will be available at: http://localhost:3000
